# TechRevive
 "TechRevive" is an innovative, Python-based web application developed to 
address the increasing demand for convenient and accessible gadget repair services. In 
today’s world, where we rely heavily on electronic devices like smartphones, laptops, and 
smartwatches, the need for prompt and efficient repair solutions is essential. This platform 
allows customers to book doorstep repair services for various electronic devices and also 
offers e-waste collection services, contributing to environmentally responsible disposal. 
Designed primarily for the FYG Store, the application centralizes all repair and e-waste 
management processes, with the store owner serving as the system's admin, who oversees all 
activities.
The system consists of four users : Admin, Technician, E-waste Collector, Customer. The admin has the privilege  control on the system. Admin registers the E-waste Collectors and technicians on the system. All the user service booking and e-waste collection requestsare managed by the admin. The services are allocated to technicians based on the availability.Technician can either accept or reject the service. E-waste collectors can view their allocated   e-waste collection requests. Once collected they can select the yard where they dumped the  e-waste. This e-waste is later processed or recycled.
